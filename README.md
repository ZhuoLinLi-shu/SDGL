# SDGL- Official PyTorch Implementation
The official implementation of Dynamic graph structure learning for multivariate time series forecasting [paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0031320323001243).  

The initial version was Dynamic Graph Learning-Neural Network for Multivariate Time Series Modeling ([arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.03273)).

The code will be released soon
